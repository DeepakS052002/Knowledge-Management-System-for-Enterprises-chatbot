 # Knowledge Management System for Enterprises

## Overview

The **Knowledge Management System for Enterprises** is designed to facilitate the efficient management, storage, retrieval, and sharing of knowledge within an organization. This system uses modern technologies and best practices to support decision-making, enhance collaboration, and improve productivity. The system leverages machine learning and AI capabilities for automation, ensuring a seamless and scalable approach for knowledge sharing.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Knowledge Repository**: Store, search, and retrieve documents, resources, and files.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Share knowledge and collaborate with other users in real time.
- **AI-Powered Search**: Use natural language processing (NLP) for smarter and more accurate search results.
- **Data Security**: Robust encryption and security mechanisms to protect sensitive enterprise data.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different organizational needs and sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar)
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **AI and ML**: Gemini AI, LangChain
- **Libraries**: 
  - Flask/Django (for web framework)
  - Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
  - scikit-learn (for machine learning)
  - SQLAlchemy (for database interaction)
  - python-dotenv (for environment variables management)
  
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or above installed
- Virtual Environment (`venv`) set up
- Required libraries installed (from `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Knowledge-Management-System.git
   cd Knowledge-Management-System
Set up the virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables (like API keys, database credentials, etc.).

Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The application should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
Once the system is up and running, you can:

Register an account and log in.

Upload documents to the knowledge repository.

Search for documents using the AI-powered search feature.

Share knowledge with other users and collaborate in real time.

Future Improvements
Integration with enterprise tools: Connect with other enterprise tools (e.g., Slack, Trello).

AI-Powered Recommendations: Use machine learning to recommend documents based on user behavior.

Mobile App: Develop a mobile version of the system for better accessibility.
